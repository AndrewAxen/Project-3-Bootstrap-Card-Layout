# Project 3 / Bootstrap Card Layout

## Requirements:

1. Create a responsive website layout with a header, main content section, and footer.
2. Design a navigation header using Bootstrap's navbar component. Include a brand/logo ("DevBlog"), navigation links for "News," "About," and "Contribute," and buttons for "Log In" and "Register." The "Register" button should trigger a modal for user registration.
3. Implement a featured articles section in the main content area. It should consist of a grid of card elements, each containing an image, title, and brief description of a tech article. Ensure that the card elements are responsive and display properly on various screen sizes.
4. Design a footer with a copyright notice ("Â© 2022 DevBlog. All rights reserved.").
